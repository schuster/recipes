  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2 large peeled butternut squash, cut in half lengthwise</li>
    <li>Olive oil</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>Black pepper</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
    <li>1 large Spanish onion, coarsely chopped</li>
    <li>2 Cortland apples, peeled, cored, and coarsely chopped</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons curry powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
    <li>Pinch of cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
    <li>5 cups chicken stock</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Directions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 475 &deg;F. Place the squash, cut side up, on a rimmed baking sheet. Sprinkly sparingly with oil, salt, and black pepper. Cover with foil, shiny side down, and transfer to the hot oven. Roast for 50&ndash;60 minutes, until the squash becomes soft. For a shorter roasting time, cut the squash into smaller pieces and roast for 30&ndash;40 minutes.</li>
    <li>In a large flameproof casserole, melt the butter. Cook the onions and apples over medium heat, stirring often, or for eight minutes, until they soften.</li>
    <li>Add the curry, cayenne, and ginger. Cook, stirring constantly, for two minutes.</li>
    <li>If squash is not soft enough to be cut with a spoon, add squash to a separate pot. Add 2&ndash;3 cups of extra water or stock and boil for 20&ndash;30 minutes.</li>
    <li>Use a spoon to transfer soft pieces of squash to the pot. Cook, stirring, for two minutes.</li>
    <li>Pour in the stock and bring to a boil. Set the cover on askewed and cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, for 20 minutes.</li>
    <li>Turn the heat to low and puree the soup with a stick blender. If you don't have a stick blender, puree the soup in a normal blender in batches.</li>
    <li>Return to medium heat. Taste for seasoning and add more salt and cayenne pepper if you like.</li>
  </ol>
