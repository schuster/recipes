  <h1>Dave's Fresh Pasta</h1>
  <p>Source: Cooking class by <a href="mailto:chefjason@live.com">Jason</a> at Dave's Fresh Pasta in Somerville, MA </p>
  <p>Serves 6</p>

  <p>Ingredients:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>&frac34; cup semolina</li>
    <li>&frac34; cup finely milled durum flour, plus more for incorporating later</li>
    <li>salt</li>
    <li>2 eggs</li>
  </ul>
  <ol>
    <li>Mix the semolina, durum flour, and a large pinch of salt together in a large bowl.
      Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the two eggs.
      Beat the eggs, gradually incorporating most of the flour mixture until a dough forms.</li>
    <li>
      Pour about half of the remaining flour from the bowl on a clean countertop,
      place the dough onto the counter,
      then add the remaining flour from the bowl to the dough.
      Knead the dough,
      adding durum flour whenever the dough seems sticky,
      until the dough is moldable like clay does not stick to your fingers when you pinch it.
      Form the dough into a ball, tightly wrap with plastic wrap, and let chill in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>Cut dough into two pieces.
      Flatten one piece into a disk, then pass through the rollers of a pasta machine on the widest setting.
      Fold dough on itself, pass through the rollers again starting with the "open" end of the folded dough,
      then repeat that procedure once more.
      Fold dough on itself a third time and pass it through the rollers again, this time with open side to the side.
      Progressively roll dough through thinner settings until you reach the desired thickness
      (the class went up to 4 on Atlas machines; note that higher numbers are harder to work with).
      Flour the dough and pass through your choice of cutters on the pasta machine.
      Cut noodles to length, then flour them and spread them out to prevent clumping.
      Repeat steps with the other piece of dough.</li>
    <li>To cook, bring a large pot of water to a boil and add salt.
      Boil the noodles until <em>al dente</em> (around 2&ndash;3 minutes, although it depends on size of the noodle),
      or according to preference.</li>
  </ol>
