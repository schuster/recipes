  <h1>Manicotti</h1>

  <p>Ingredients:</p>

    <li>&frac34; pounds ground beef</li>
    <li>1 clove garlic, crushed</li>
    <li>1 cup cottage cheese</li>
    <li>&frac12; cup sour cream</li>

    <li>4 ounces mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>
    <li>&frac12; teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 large jar of tomato sauce, around 45 ounces</li> <!-- 45 ounces was plenty last time I made it; could arguably do 36oz -->
    <li>Parmesan cheese, shredded</li>
    <li>&frac12; teaspoon oregano</li>
  </ul>

  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350&deg;.</li>
    <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil.
      Add the manicotti and boil until they are just slightly flexible,
      about 3&ndash;4 minutes.
      Drain and rinse with cold water.
    </li>
    <li>While the pot of water is coming to a boil,
      heat a skillet over medium-high heat.
      Add the garlic and ground beef and brown the beef.
      Drain the beef and empty it into a bowl.
    </li>
    <li>
      Mix in the cottage cheese,
      sour cream,
      mayonnaise,
      mozzarella,
      and salt into the bowl with the browned meat.</li>
    <li>Stuff the manicotti with the meat-and-cheese mixture,
      arranging in a single layer in a greased 9x13 casserole dish.
    <li>Add any leftover filling to the top of the manicotti,
      then cover with tomato sauce.
      Sprinkle the Parmesan and oregano on top.
    <li>Cover with foil and bake for 15 minutes.
      Remove the foil and continue baking for another 15 minutes.
  </ol>
