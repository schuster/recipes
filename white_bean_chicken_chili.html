  <!-- Source attribution would go here, like <p>Source: The United States of Pizza</p> -->

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
    <li>1 large onion, diced medium</li>
    <li>1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into bite-sized chunks</li>
    <li>1 (15-ounce) can Great Northern beans, drained and rinsed</li>
    <li>1 (15-ounce) can cannellini beans, drained and rinsed</li>
    <li>1 (4.5-ounce) can green chiles, drained and rinsed</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
    <li>1 &frac12; teaspoon cumin</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
    <li>&frac18; teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
    <li>2 cups chicken broth
      (<strong>NOTE:</strong> try an extra 1 or 2 cups of broth next time; the soup seems to not have enough liquid sometimes and serves less than I'd expect)
    </li>
    <li>2 tablespoons corn starch, for thickening (optional)</li>
    <li>Shredded Monterey Jack cheese, for garnish</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Directions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Heat the oil over medium-high heat in a large pot.
      Add the onion and cook,
      stirring occasionally,
      until the onion softens and starts to turn translucent.</li>
    <li>Add the chicken and cook,
      stirring occasionally,
      until the chicken is cooked through.</li>
    <li>Add the beans, chiles, garlic, cumin, pepper, cayenne pepper, and broth
      and bring to a boil.
      To thicken (optional),
      mix the corn starch with 2 tablespoons water
      and shake in a tightly-sealed container.
      Slowly stir the mixture into to the pot until chili has reached desired thickness.</li>
    </li>
    <li>Serve in bowls with Monterey Jack cheese sprinkled on top.</li>
  </ol>
