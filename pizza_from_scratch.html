  <p>Dough ingredients:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>3 cups all-purpose or bread flour, plus more as needed</li>

    <li>2 teaspoons coarse kosher or sea salt, plus extra for sprinkling</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Pizza ingredients:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>dough from dough recipe</li>
    <li>all-purpose flour for stretching or rolling the dough</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, or more as needed</li>
    <li>2 cups tomato sauce</li>
    <li>2 cups grated mozzarella cheese</li>
    <li>salt and black pepper</li>
    <li>additional toppings (optional)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Dough Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Combine the flour, yeast, and salt in a food processor.
      Turn the machine on and add 1 cup water and the oil through the feed tube.</li>
    <li>Process for about 30 seconds, adding more water, a little at a time, until the mixture forms a ball and is slightly sticky to the touch.
      If it is still dry, add another tablespoon or two of water and process for another 10 seconds.
      (In the unlikely event that the mixture is too sticky, add flour a tablespoon at a time.)</li>
    <li>Turn the dough onto a floured work surface and knead by hand for a few seconds to form a smooth, round dough ball.
      Put the dough in a bowl and cover with plastic wrap; let rise until the dough doubles in size, 1 to 2 hours.
      (You can cut this rising time short if you're in a hurry, or you can let the dough rise more slowly, in the refrigerator, for up to 6 to 8 hours.)
      Proceed to the pizza steps or wrap the dough tightly in plastic wrap or a zipper bag and freeze for up to a month.
      (Defrost in the bag or a covered bowl in the refrigerator or at room temperature; bring to room temperature before shaping.)</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Pizza Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Heat the oven to 500&deg;F.
      When the dough is ready, knead it lightly, form it into a ball, and divide it into 2 pieces if you like; roll each piece into a round ball and put each ball on a lightly floured surface.
      Sprinkle with a little more flour, cover with plastic wrap or a towel, and let rest for about 20 minutes.</li>
    <li>Roll or lightly press each dough ball into a flat round, lightly flouring the work surface and the dough as necessary (use only as much flour as you need to).
      If you have a peel and baking stone, roll or pat out the dough on the peel, as thinly as you like, turning occasionally and sprinkling it with flour as necessary.
      If you're using baking sheets, oil them, then press each dough ball into a flat round directly on the sheets.</li>
    <li>Drizzle the rounds with the olive oil, then top them with the sauce and cheese; sprinkle with salt and pepper.
      Sprinkle the pizza stone (if using) with cornmeal, to prevent sticking.
      Put the baking sheet in the oven or slide the pizza directly onto the stone and bake until the crust is crisp and the cheese melted, usually 8 to 12 minutes.
      Let stand for several minutes before slicing to set up the cheese.
