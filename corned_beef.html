  <p>Ingredients:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>2 large carrots, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch coins</li>
    <li>1 medium yellow or sweet onion, thinly sliced</li>
    <li>1 large garlic clove, thinly sliced</li>
    <li>1 large bay leaf</li>
    <li>1 3-pound corned beef brisket (in package with spice packet)</li>
    <li>1 12-ounce bottle of dark beer such as stout or porter (for a nonalcoholic version, replace the beer with an additional 1 &frac12; cups beef broth)</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon light brown sugar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon Dijon mustard</li>
    <li>1 to 2 cups beef broth (plus additional as needed)</li>
    <li>6-8 medium red potatoes, rinsed and quartered</li>
    <li>1 small head green cabbage</li>
  </ul>

  <ol>
    <li>Place the carrots, onion, garlic and bay leaf in the bottom of a 6-quart slow cooker.
        Place the corned beef on top of the vegetables.</li>
    <li>Whisk the spice packet that came with the corned beef together with the beer, vinegar, brown sugar and mustard. Pour over the corned beef, then pour in the 2 cups beef broth. The liquid should completely submerge the vegetables and partially cover the corned beef â€” the amount needed to do this will vary depending on the depth and model of slow cooker, so add more broth as necessary.
    </li>
    </li>Place the potatoes on top of the corned beef.
    <li>Close the slow cooker and cook on low for 6 1/2 hours before adding the cabbage. (If your slow cooker has a warm function, you can hold the beef and vegetables for up to 90 minutes before adding the cabbage if needed.)
    </li>
    <li>Add the cabbage: Core the cabbage and slice into 8 wedges. Open the slow cooker and place the cabbage on top of the potatoes and corned beef. Close and cook for another 1 1/2 hours, until the cabbage is tender but still retains its shape.</li>
    <li>Remove the cabbage with tongs, then carefully lift the corned beef out of the liquid and transfer to a cutting board. Strain the potatoes, carrots and onions from the cooking liquid, discarding the liquid. Slice the corned beef and serve with the cabbage and vegetables.</.li>
  </ol>
