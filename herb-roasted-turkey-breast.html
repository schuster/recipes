  <p>Serves 6-8</p>

  <p>Ingredients:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>8 tablespoons (1 stick) butter, divided</li>
    <li>1 &frac12; pounds sage sausage, removed from casing</li>
    <li>1 large onion, finely chopped (about 2 cups)</li>
    <li>4 large stalks celery, finely chopped (about 2 cups)</li>
    <li>4 cloves garlic, minced or grated on microplane, divided</li>
    <li>&frac14; cup minced fresh sage leaves (or 2 teaspoons dried sage leaves)</li>
    <li>32 ounces (4 cups) low-sodium chicken or turkey stock, preferably homemade</li>
    <li>3 large whole eggs</li>
    <li>2 &frac12; pounds (about 2 loaves) high quality sandwich bread or soft
    Italian or French bread, cut into 1-inch cubes, stale or dried in the
    oven</li>
    <li>&frac12; cup minced fresh parsley, divided</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons minced fresh oregano</li>
    <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1 whole bone-in, skin-on turkey breast (about 4 to 5 pounds), patted dry</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Notes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Make sure the turkey breast is <em>fully</em> defrosted the morning of; otherwise the turkey may take too long to cook. Put it in a bowl of cold water if not.</li>
    <li>The parsley in particular takes a long time to pick and prep, so consider doing that the day before along with the vegetables.</li>
    <li>Leave lots of time to fold the bread cubes into the sausage mixture:
    maybe 15-20 minutes. It takes a long time and at first will seem like
      there's way too much bread, but it will eventually all fit.</li>
    <li>Consider salting the turkey breast ahead of time. At Christmas 2024 it
    came out a little dry (although we also didn't fully defrost it that time,
    so it may have been overcooked).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Instructions:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 450°F.
      In a large Dutch oven, melt 5 tablespoons butter over medium-high heat until foaming subsides (don't allow butter to brown), about 2 minutes.
      Add sausage and mash with stiff whisk or potato masher to break up into fine pieces (largest pieces should be no greater than &frac14;-inch).
      Cook, stirring frequently until only a few bits of pink remain, about 8 minutes.
      Add onions, celery, garlic, and sage and cook, stirring frequently, until vegetables are softened, about 10 minutes.
      Remove from heat and add half of chicken stock.</li>
    <li>Whisk remaining chicken stock, eggs, and 3 tablespoons parsley in a medium bowl until homogeneous.
      Stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, slowly pour egg mixture into sausage mixture.
      Add bread cubes and fold gently until evenly mixed.</li>
    <li>Using poultry shears, cut off and remove any back portion that may be attached to the turkey (there may not be any).
      Fill cavity under turkey breast and under flap of fat around neck with stuffing.
      Transfer remaining stuffing to a buttered 9- by 13-inch baking dish and place turkey on top.</li>
    <li>Using your hands, carefully separate the turkey skin from the meat by inserting at the bottom of the breast, being careful not to tear it.
      In a small bowl, combine remaining butter with remaining parsley and oregano.
      Add 1 tablespoon kosher salt and 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper.
      Stir with a fork until homogenous.
      Rub mixture evenly over and under turkey skin.</li>
    <li>Transfer to oven and roast until stuffing starts to brown, about 45 minutes.
      Remove from oven, transfer turkey to a wire rack set in a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet, and return turkey to oven.
      Continue roasting until turkey is golden brown and crisp, and thickest part near bone registers 145 to 150°F on an instant-read thermometer, about 30 minutes longer.
      Remove from oven, transfer to a plate, and let rest for 20 minutes.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, pour exuded juices back over stuffing.
      Return stuffing to oven and cook until it's golden brown and registers 160°F on an instant read thermometer, about 15 minutes.
      Carve turkey, spread over stuffing, and serve.</li>
  </ol>
