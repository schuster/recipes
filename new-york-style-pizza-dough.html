  <h1>New York-Style Pizza Dough</h1>
  <p>Makes dough for 1 large pie</p>
  <p>Source: The United States of Pizza</p>

  <p>Dough ingredients:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>1 &frac34; cups bread flour, plus more as needed</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons sugar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
    <li>&frac12; cup plus 3 tablespoons water</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>&frac12; teaspoon salt</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Place the flour, sugar, and yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook.
      Mix on low to combine, about 5 seconds.
      Add the water and the olive oil and mix until a ball forms,
      about 2 minutes.</li>
    <li>Let the dough rest for about 10 minutes.
      Add the salt.
      Knead on medium speed for 12 minutes.
      If the dough is too wet or sticky,
      add a teaspoon of flour and mix until a ball comes cleanly off the side of the bowl.
      When the dough is ready it should be firm, smooth, and supple.</li>
    <li>To test elasticity,
      hold a 1-inch piece between your fingers and stretch the dough to make a windowpane.
      It should stretch enough to be translucent without tearing, like bubblegum.
      If not, knead for 5 minutes more and test again.
      Keep going until the dough passes the test, up to 30 minutes more.</li>
    <li>Pour a teaspoon of olive oil into a medium bowl.
      Wet your hands with water,
      shape the dough into a ball,
      and place it in the bowl.
      Turn the dough to coat it with oil
      (this prevents a crust from forming on its surface as it rises).
      Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough rise in the refrigerator overnight or up to 72 hours.
      After about 12 hours, the dough will be wider and taller,
      approximately doubled in size.</li>
