  <h1>Gnocchi</h1>
  <p>Makes enough dumplings for 6-8</p>

  <p>Ingredients:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>3 russet potatoes</li>
    <li>2 &frac12; cups flour</li>
    <li>&frac12; teaspoon salt</li>
  </ul>

  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350&deg;.</li>
    <li>Prick the potatoes all over with a fork.
        Set them on the oven rack and bake for 1 hour or until tender when pierced; let cool. </li>
    <li>Peel the potatoes and mash them.
        Add the flour and salt and beat with a wooden spoon until the flour is incorporated; the dough will be sticky at first.</li>
    <li>Break off a piece of dough and roll into a ball 2 inches in diameter.
        On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough with your palms to create a 10-inch rope, dusting with additional flour if the dough is sticky.
        With a knife, cut the rope into &frac12;-inch pieces.
    <li>Lightly flour a baking sheet. With your forefinger, hold one piece against the inside of a fork's tines.
        Pressing lightly, roll dough down the tines, marking an indentation in the underside of the dough so you form ridges on the other side.
        Set the dumplings on the baking sheet.
        Repeat with the remaining pieces.</li>
  </ol>
