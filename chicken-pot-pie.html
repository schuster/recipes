  <p>Crust Ingredients:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>1&frac14; cups all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling</li>
    <li>&frac12; teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>10 tablespoons (1&frac14; sticks) frozen or cold unsalted butter, cut into chunks</li>
    <li>1 egg yolk</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons ice water, plus more if necessary</li>
  </ul>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Combine the flour and salt in a food processor and pulse once or twice.
      Add the butter all at once; process until the mixture is uniform, about 10 seconds (do not overprocess).
      Add the egg yolk and process for another few seconds.
    </li>
    <li>
      Put the mixture in a bowl and add 3 tablespoons ice water;
      mix with your hands until you can form the dough into a ball,
      adding another another tablespoon or two of ice water if necessary (if you overdo it and the mixture becomes sodden, add a little more flour).
      Form into a ball, wrap in plastic, and freeze for 10 minutes or refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.
      (You can refrigerate for up to a couple of days or freeze, tightly wrapped, for up to a couple of weeks.)
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>Filling Ingredients:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>1 whole chicken, 3 to 4 pounds, trimmed of excess fat</li>
    <li>2 onions, quartered</li>
    <li>3 bay leaves</li>
    <li>10 whole black peppercorns</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons butter or extra virgin olive oil, plus more for greasing the baking dish</li>
    <li>1 cup pearl onions, peeled (frozen are fine: run under cold water to thaw them a bit, then drain)</li>
    <li>2 large or 4 small-to-medium carrots, diced</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh sage or 1 teaspoon dried sage</li>
    <li>Freshly-ground black pepper</li>
    <li>&frac12; cup heavy cream</li>
    <li>1 cup peas (frozen are fine; thawing unnecessary)</li>
    <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>

<ol>
  <li>
    Put the chicken and onions in a large pot with just enough water to cover.
    Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then immediately reduce the heat to medium-low.
    Skim any foam that rises to the surface.
    Add the bay leaves, peppercorns, and a generous pinch of salt.
    Simmer until the chicken and vegetables are nearly tender and the chicken is cooked through, about 45 minutes;
    the bird is done when an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh reads 155&ndash;165&deg;F.</li>
  <li>
    Remove the chicken to cool and save the cooking liquid.
    (This is a good time to make the crust dough if you haven't already done so.)
  </li>
  <li>
    Remove the chicken meat from the bones, roughly chop or pull into pieces, and reserve.
    Return the carcass to the pot (break the pieces up a bit so they're all submerged, but don't add any more water),
    and bring the liquid back to a boil.
    Reduce the heat so the liquid bubbles steadily and cook,
    stirring occasionally,
    for 20 minutes or so.
    Strain into a wide pot,
    bring the liquid to a boil,
    and reduce until you have about 1&frac12; cups, 15 to 30 minutes, depending on how much you started with.
    (At this point, the chicken and cooking liquid may be stored separately in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.)
    If you're baking the pie now,
    heat the oven to 375&deg;F and generously grease a 2-quart baking dish.
  </li>
  <li>
    Put 2 tablespoons butter or oil in a deep skillet over medium heat.
    When the butter is melted or the oil is hot, add the onions and carrots and cook,
    stirring frequently,
    until just beginning to soften,
    about 5 minutes.
    Reduce the heat to medium-low and stir in the flour; continue cooking and stirring until it just turns tan.
    Add the sage and cook and stir for another minute.
    (At this point you can refrigerate the vegetable mixture for up to a day, then reheat just before proceeding.)
  </li>
  <li>
    Add the chicken-cooking liquid and the cream to the vegetable-flour mixture and turn the heat up to medium.
    Cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture begins to bubble and thicken,
    but don't let it come to a rolling boil.
    Taste and adjust the seasoning,
    turn off the heat,
    and stir in the chicken pieces and the peas.
    Put the mixture into the prepared baking dish.
    (At this point, you may cover and refrigerate the filling for up to a day;
    bring to room temperature before proceeding.)
  </li>
  <li>
    Roll out the crust dough large enough to cover the baking dish (about 2 inches wider than the diameter of the dish).
    Lay it on top of the dish and flute it as for a piecrust (see page 927) or just leave it draped over the sides a little.
    Use a sharp knife to cut 3 or 5 vents in the top.
    Brush the top with the beaten egg.
    Bake for 50 to 60 minutes, until the crust is deeply golden and the filling is bubbling.
  </li>
</ol>
