  <h1>Cuban Bread</h1>
  <p>Source: Cook's Country</p>
  <p>Makes two 15-inch loaves</p>

  <p>Sponge Ingredients:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>&frac14; cup water</li>
    <li>&frac14; cup (1 &frac14; ounces) all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>&frac14; teaspoon instant or rapid-rise yeast</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Dough Ingredients:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> 3 cups (15 ounces) all-purpose flour</li>
    <li> 2 teaspoons instant or rapid-rise yeast</li>
    <li> 1 &frac12; teaspoons table salt</li>
    <li> 1 cup warm water (110 degrees)</li>
    <li>&frac14; cup lard</li>
    <li> 1 (16 by 12-inch) rectangular disposable aluminum roasting pan</li>
  </ul>
  <ol>
    <li>FOR THE SPONGE: Whisk all ingredients with fork in liquid measuring cup until
consistency of thin pancake batter. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate
overnight (sponge will rise and collapse).</li>

<li>FOR THE DOUGH: Whisk flour, yeast, and salt together in bowl of stand mixer.
Add warm water, lard, and sponge. Fit mixer with dough hook and mix on low
speed until no dry flour remains, about 2 minutes, scraping down bowl as needed.
Increase speed to medium and knead for 8 minutes. (Dough will be sticky and
clear sides of bowl but still stick to bottom.)</li>

<li>Turn out dough onto lightly floured counter, sprinkle top with flour, and knead
briefly to form smooth ball, about 30 seconds. Transfer dough to greased large
bowl and turn to coat. Cover with plastic and let dough rise at room temperature
until doubled in size, about 45 minutes.</li>

<li>Line rimless baking sheet with parchment paper. Turn out dough onto floured
    counter and cut into 2 equal pieces, about 14 ounces each.</li>

<li>Working with 1 piece of dough at a time, flatten into 10 by 6-inch rectangle with
long side parallel to counter's edge. Fold top edge of rectangle down to midline,
pressing to seal. Fold bottom edge of rectangle up to midline, pressing to seal.
Fold dough in half so top and bottom edges meet; pinch seam and ends to seal.
Flip dough seam side down and gently roll into 15-inch loaf with tapered ends.</li>

<li>Transfer loaf, seam side down, to 1 side of prepared sheet. Repeat shaping with
second piece of dough and place about 3 inches from first loaf on other side of
sheet. Cover loosely with plastic and let rise at room temperature until puffy,
about 30 minutes. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 450
degrees.</li>

<li>Using sharp paring knife in swift, fluid motion, make &frac18;-inch-deep lengthwise
slash along top of each loaf, starting and stopping about 1 &frac12; inches from ends.
Cover loaves with inverted disposable pan. Bake for 20 minutes. Using tongs,
remove disposable pan and continue to bake until loaves are light golden brown
and centers register 210 degrees, 10 to 12 minutes longer.</li>

<li>Transfer loaves to wire rack and let cool for 30 minutes. Serve warm.</li>

<li>TO MAKE AHEAD: Fully cooled loaves can be wrapped in aluminum foil and
stored at room temperature for up to 2 days. Cooled bread can also be wrapped in
plastic wrap, then in foil, and frozen for up to 1 month. Unwrap and warm before
serving.</li>
