  <p>Source: Cook's Country</p>
  <p>Serves 6 to 8</p>

  <p>Pork Ingredients:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>&frac13; cup kosher salt</li>
    <li>&frac13; cup packed light brown sugar</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon lime zest (2 limes)</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon orange zest</li>
    <li>3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
    <li>&frac12; teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
    <li>1 (5-pound) boneless pork butt with fat cap</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Mojo Ingredients:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>&frac13; cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>6 garlic cloves, minced</li>
    <li>&frac13; cup pineapple juice</li>
    <li>&frac13; cup orange juice</li>
    <li>&frac13; cup lime juice (3 limes)</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon yellow mustard</li>
    <li>1 &frac14; teaspoons ground cumin</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    <li>&frac34; teaspoon pepper</li>
    <li>&frac34; teaspoon dried oregano</li>
    <li>&frac14; teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
    <li>Thinly sliced onion rounds</li>
  </ul>
  <ol>
    <li>FOR THE PORK: Combine salt, sugar, lime zest, orange zest, garlic, cumin,
oregano, and pepper flakes in bowl. Using sharp knife, trim fat cap on pork to &frac14;
inch. Cut 1-inch crosshatch pattern in fat cap.</li>

<li>Place pork on large double layer of plastic wrap. Sprinkle pork all over with salt
mixture. Wrap pork tightly in plastic, place on plate, and refrigerate for at least 12
hours or up to 24 hours.</li>

<li>Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 325 degrees. Unwrap pork;
transfer to Dutch oven, fat side up; and pour 2 cups water around pork. Cover,
transfer to oven, and cook until meat registers 175 degrees in center, 2 &frac; to 3
hours.</li>


<li>Uncover pork and continue to cook until meat registers 195 degrees in center and
fork slips easily in and out of meat, 45 minutes to 1 &frac34; hours longer. Transfer pork
to carving board, tent with aluminum foil, and let rest for 45 minutes.</li>

<li>FOR THE MOJO: While pork is resting, heat oil and garlic in small saucepan over
low heat, stirring often, until tiny bubbles appear and garlic is fragrant and
straw-colored, 3 to 5 minutes. Let cool for at least 5 minutes. Whisk pineapple
juice, orange juice, lime juice, mustard, cumin, salt, pepper, oregano, and pepper
flakes into cooled garlic oil.
</li>

<li>Slice pork as thin as possible (some meat may shred; this is OK) and transfer to
    serving platter. Serve with onion and mojo.</li>
