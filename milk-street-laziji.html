  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>For the seasoning salt,
      toast peppercorns in a pan over medium-low heat.
      Grind the peppercorns and strain them to remove inedible parts.
      Add sugar and salt, then set aside.</li>
    <li>Mix together the soy sauce, rice vinegar, 2 Tbsp sugar, and egg whites.
      Pour over the chicken thighs,
      then let sit for 20&ndash;30 minutes at room temperature.</li>
    <li>For the chili oil,
      mix together the Sichuan chiles, Sichuan chile flakes, 1 Tbsp whole Sichuan peppercorns, and 1 cup of vegetable oil.
      Heat the oil over medium-low heat until it reaches 275 degrees, about 3&ndash;5 minutes,
      then strain the oil.
    </li>
    <li>Drain the oil and other moisture off of the chicken in a large strainer or colander.
      In a large bowl or container,
      mix together the cornstarch, &frac14; cup ground Sichuan peppercorns, 2 Tbsp sugar, and salt.
      Dredge the pieces of chicken a few at a time
      then shake off excess coating in a fine-mesh strainer.
      Place chicken on top of a wire cooling rack.</li>
    <li>In a large Dutch oven,
      heat the peanut oil to 350 degrees.
      When the oil has reached temperature,
      fry the chicken in batches until crisp with golden highlights, about 5 minutes per batch.
      Transfer chicken to wire cooling rack.
      Be sure to let the oil come back up to 350 degrees before starting the second batch.</li>
    <li>Put the fried chicken in a large bowl and add scallions, 1 Tbsp of seasoning salt, 6 Tbsp of chili oil (or to taste), and cilantro.
      Serve with extra chili oil on the side.
